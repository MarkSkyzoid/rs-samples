# rs-samples
Collection of small, mostly independent and well-commented Rust code
samples.  
Mostly a learning exercise, with the hope that others will find it useful. Feel
free to contribute to it by adding other simple examples.

## rust-cookbook
There is a collection of excellent rust samples available at [rust-cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/). Be sure to check those out too!

## Contributing
Simply fork the repo and add your own folder with the example, I'll be happy
to merge it in.
